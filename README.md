## Features

### Dynamic Greeting and Background

Displays a greeting message based on the time of day and updates the background of the page accordingly. The greeting and background change dynamically based on the current hour of the client. The time of day is determined by the client's local time compared against a dictionary of times available in `timeWindow.ts`.

### Custom Project Management

I created a method to manage projects that allows me to easily add new projects to the website. By creating a dictionary of projects I want to display on the site in the `project.ts` file, I can easily add new projects to the site by adding a new object to the dictionary. The object contains a title, description, image, and link to the project.

#### Project Details System

Each project's GitHub repository contains a folder, `.projectDetails`, that contains `details.json` and `ogImage.jpg` files. The `details.json` file contains the project's id, name, description, README url, colors, and status.

My profile repository's details file looks like this:
```json
{
  "id": "0",
  "name": "Profile Repository",
  "description": "My GitHub profile repository.",
  "url": "jackgraddon/main/README.md",
  "backgroundColor": "rgb(174, 207, 219)",
  "buttonColor": "rgb(23, 94, 132)",
  "status": "Active"
}
```

#### Project Deck

A `ProjectDeck` component is used to display a showcase of three projects. The component is given three project ids, and pulls the corresponding projects from the `project.ts` file. The component displays the project's image, and creates a button to open the project page with the project's details.

#### Project Page

The `ProjectPage` component is used to display the details of a project. The component is given a project id from the parent page, `/project?id={pid}`, and pulls the corresponding project from the `project.ts` file. The dictionary contains an url to a GutHub repository. The component will fetch the README file from the repository and display it on the page, converted to HTML using the `react-markdown` library.file.
